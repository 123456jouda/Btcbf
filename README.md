# Btcbf                                                                
A new way to support Btcbf and to be thankful to open source projects, is to buy the icon of Btcbf as NFT from [here](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/29326638034131043689181811786030646451603799113214635741285531928455660175365/). There are 5 ones available. The next versions will have new looking and higher value.
## **Quick Start**
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/vlnahp/Btcbf.git

 $ cd Btcbf

 $ pip install -r requirements.txt

 $ python Btcbf.py or  $ python3 Btcbf.py in Linux
```

## **Description**

Btcbf is a fast and efficient bitcoin private key brute force tool written in python. It works based on generating random or sequential private keys and their corresponding public address. Then checking the address through an online API or an offline database.

What makes Btcbf fast, is mainly the `bit` library. Thanks to its developer!

## The Goal
The main goal is to prove bitcoin is secure. At least until the day that Quantum computers start working against it!:innocent:

There are also some useful tools implemented.

## **Offline Database Options**
  Lets be honest. Searching online takes too long and the addresses with balance included in the program are to scarce (as having a current text file with all
  addresses would make this repository over 5gb)
  So the users that want can download the text file from here and replace it with the addresses.txt
  http://addresses.loyce.club/

## **Requirements**

  In offline mode, a database is necessary. By default, it is `address.txt` containing some addresses. (Add as many as positive balance addresses possible to this file; this increases the chance of success, find more addresses [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html) ).

To install the requirements run the command below:

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```  


## **Usage**
Just execute this command: `$ python Btcbf.py` or `$ python3 Btcbf.py` for Linux, Btcbf tells you what to do!

Type your desired action and follow instructions. (I love to interact with my programðŸ™‚)

## **Donation**

Make my BTC address a good option to be on the list!:cowboy_hat_face:
